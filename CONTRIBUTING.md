## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to felipe@migrandama.com.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Install [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
   - Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and/or [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)
   - Set up your preferred IDE (VS Code or Android Studio) with Flutter plugins
   - Run `flutter doctor` to verify your setup


2. **Fork the Repository**
   ```bash
   # Clone your fork
   git clone https://github.com/dojosgithub/mestinow.git
   cd repository-name

   # Add upstream remote
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/dojosgithub/mestinow.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   # Check available devices
   flutter devices

   # Run the app
   flutter run
   ```

## Development Process

  <!-- This project uses the GitLab Flow branching strategy.
  - `main` is the default branch and it should always be in a deployable state.
  - All development is done in feature branches off of `main`.
  - When a feature is complete, it is merged into `main`.
  - When a release is ready to be deployed, it is tagged with a version number, pushed to `main` and, after testing, it is merged into `production`.
  - `production` is always in deployable state and represents the current production version of the app.
  For more information regarding the GitLab Flow branching strategy, please refer to the [GitLab Flow Best Practices](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/version-control/what-are-gitlab-flow-best-practices/). -->

1. **Create a Branch**
  Use clear and descriptive branch names and mention the GitHub issue number.
   ```bash
   # From main
   git checkout -b feature/123-your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/24-your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Write meaningful commit messages
   - Keep commits atomic and focused
   - Add tests for new features
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Follow Flutter's style guide

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   flutter test

   # Run static analysis
   flutter analyze

   # Format code
   dart format .
   ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update Your Fork**
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```
2. **Commit Your Changes**
   Make sure your commit messages are clear and descriptive and that they have a reference to the issue number
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Fixes #123: Description of the fix"
   ```

2. **Push Your Changes**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Submit a Pull Request**
   - Fill out the PR template completely
   - Link any relevant issues
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Request review from maintainers

4. **PR Review Process**
   - Maintainers will review your code
   - Address any requested changes
   - Once approved, your PR will be merged
