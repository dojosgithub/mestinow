# MestiNow - Your Personal Mestinon & MG Symptom Tracker

## Overview

**MestiNow is a mobile application specifically designed to help individuals with Myasthenia Gravis (MG) manage their Mestinon (Pyridostigmine Bromide) medication intake and track their symptoms effectively** [1]. This app was created out of a personal need for a more flexible and accurate way to schedule and log Mestinon doses, taking into account the immediate and time-sensitive nature of the medication's effects [2, 3]. Unlike generic medication scheduling apps, MestiNow allows users to log doses based on when they actually take them, ensuring the next reminder is set accordingly [2]. The app also provides tools to monitor various MG symptoms, helping users understand the correlation between medication and their well-being [1, 4].

## Background

Living with Myasthenia Gravis involves a daily cycle where symptoms worsen as the day progresses, with sleep offering a temporary reset [2]. While MG itself may not be inherently painful, the strain on muscles due to weakening can lead to significant discomfort [2]. Managing this condition often requires strict adherence to a Mestinon regimen, as the medication provides only temporary relief [2]. **Accurate timing of Mestinon doses is crucial; taking it too early can cause stomach upset, while delaying it can lead to the onset of symptoms and associated pain** [2]. Existing medication scheduling applications often lack the flexibility needed for MG patients, who might need to adjust their dose times based on their immediate needs and wake-up times [2]. MestiNow was developed to address this gap, providing a user-friendly solution for tracking medication intake in a way that adapts to the user's actual schedule [3].
